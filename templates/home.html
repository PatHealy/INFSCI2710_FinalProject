	<h3>Common Operations:</h3>
	<p>As a busy help-desk operator, we assume you will want to get to these operations the most quickly:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Todo
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<h4>Browsing!</h4>
	<p>Most browse operations can be handled on the <a href="/browse">browse page</a></p>. The browse page allows you to...
	<ul>
		<li>
			<p>Casually browse any table of the database</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Search by any column, including multiple layered searches of the same table!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Click the headers to re-order the contents by that column.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Perform more complicated searches with the light-blue buttons on each row (they say what they do!)</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Edit or delete any given row.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<h4>Data Agregation</h4>
	<p>Check out the <a href="/aggregation">data aggregation page</a> for a collection of dynamically-calculated metrics, which you may find useful to the business.</p>
